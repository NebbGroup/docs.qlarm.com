## Recipients

There are four types of notifications that recipients can receive:

- SMS Text Message on a mobile phone <img src="/phone_call_and_sms_recipient.png" alt="phone call and sms recipient icon" class = "logo_resize">
- Voice Calls <img src="/phone_call_and_sms_recipient.png" alt="phone call and sms recipient icon" class = "logo_resize">
- E-mail <img src="/email_recipient.png" alt="email icon" class = "logo_resize">
- Push Notifications <img src="/push_notification_recipient.png" alt="push notification icon" class = "logo_resize">

The Recipients configuration lists its recipients in a table, which shows their name, selected notification types, number of recipients for the recipients group. An Individual Recipient represents a single user that can receive notifications. To add a recipient click the <img src="/add_recipient_button.png" alt="add recipient button" > button by which a form appears:

    <figcaption>Fig 2. Individual recipient configuration</figcaption>
</figure>

The Individual recipient form requires basic contact information about the recipient. To choose a type of notification that the individual recipient will receive, you need to fill a specific contact field and enable it by toggling the switch <img src="/recipient_toggle_switch.png" alt="add recipient button" >. After you are done configuring the individual recipient save the configuration by clicking the <img src="/add_recipient_form_button.png" alt="add recipient button" > button or <img src="/cancel_recipient_button.png" alt="add recipient button" > to discard the configuration. 

A Recipients Group represents a collection of recipients that can be the receiver of notifications. To add a recipients group click the <img src="/add_recipient_groups_button.png" alt="add recipient button" > button and a form appears:

<figure class="image_container">
    <img class="center_image figure_resize2" src="/add_recipient_groups_form.png" alt="configure header in view mode">
    <figcaption>Fig 3. Recipients group configuration</figcaption>
</figure>

The form requires that you select a name for the group of recipients, group of recipients from the dropdown list and a template or schedule for when this group is reachable. After you are done configuring the recipients group save the configuration by clicking the <img src="/add_recipient_form_button.png" alt="add recipient button" > button or <img src="/cancel_recipient_button.png" alt="add recipient button" > to discard the configuration. 

After filling the table with individual recipients and recipients groups, you can easily search them by using the search text field and filter them by using the filter select list.
