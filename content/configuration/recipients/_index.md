In the Recipients configuration tab we can define the recipients of notifications. Recipients are categorized as individual <img src="/individual_recipient_icon.png" alt="individual recipient icon" class = "logo_resize"> and groups <img src="/recipients_groups_icon.png" alt="recipient groups icon" class = "logo_resize"> of recipients, each recipient can receive notifications in many forms.

## Recipients

There are four types of notifications that a recipients can receive:

- SMS Text Message on a mobile phone <img src="/phone_call_and_sms_recipient.png" alt="phone call and sms recipient icon" class = "logo_resize">
- Voice Calls <img src="/phone_call_and_sms_recipient.png" alt="phone call and sms recipient icon" class = "logo_resize">
- E-mail <img src="/email_recipient.png" alt="email icon" class = "logo_resize">
- Push Notifications <img src="/push_notification_recipient.png" alt="push notification icon" class = "logo_resize">

The Recipients configuration lists its recipients in a table, which shows their name, selected notification types, number of recipients for the recipients group. An Individual Recipient represents a single user that can receive some kind of notification. To add a recipient we click on the <img src="/add_recipient_button.png" alt="add recipient button" > button and a form appears:

    <img class="center_image" src="/add_recipient_form.png" alt="configure header in view mode">
    <figcaption>Fig 2. Individual recipient configuration</figcaption>
</figure>

The form requires basic and contact information about the individual recipient. To choose a type of notification that the individual recipient will receive, we need to fill a certain contact field and enable it by toggling the switch <img src="/recipient_toggle_switch.png" alt="add recipient button" >. After we are finished configuring the individual recipient we can save by pressing the <img src="/add_recipient_form_button.png" alt="add recipient button" > button or <img src="/cancel_recipient_button.png" alt="add recipient button" > to discard the configuration. 

A Recipients Group represents a collection of recipients that can be the receiver of notifications. Groups also have schedules for when they are reachable.To add a recipients group we click on the <img src="/add_recipient_groups_button.png" alt="add recipient button" > button and a form appears:

    <img class="center_image" src="/add_recipient_groups_form.png" alt="configure header in view mode">
    <figcaption>Fig 3. Recipients group configuration</figcaption>
</figure>

The form requires a name for the group of recipients, group of recipients by selecting them in the dropdown list and a template or schedule for when this group is reachable. After we are finished configuring the recipients group we can save by pressing the <img src="/add_recipient_form_button.png" alt="add recipient button" > button or <img src="/cancel_recipient_button.png" alt="add recipient button" > to discard the configuration. 

After filling the table with individual recipients and recipients groups we can easily search them by using the search text field and filter them by using the filter select list.
