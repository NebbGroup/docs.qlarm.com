Permissions names mainly correspond to the application main menu items, and they refer to these pages and their functionalities. But sections or functionalities other than pages can be also set under permission like Scopes, or Acknowledge of Event. After (de)selecting permissions for a chosen role, the role can be saved by clicking the "Save changes" button <img src="/save_changes_button.png" >
