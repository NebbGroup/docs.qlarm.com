General settings allows us to change the logo of the application that appears in the right corner of every page, so the organization can have a more personal experience.

<figure class="image_container">
    <img class="center_image" src="/general_settings.png" alt="Widget menu">
    <figcaption >Fig 1. General settings</figcaption>
</figure>

By clicking on the button we can upload a logo that represents the organization and use it to make QLARM a more personal experience. By default the QLARM logo is used.
