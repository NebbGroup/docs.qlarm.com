The table lists all of the tags for certain endpoints that are enabled and set for live view (for more details in Endpoints). The table shows the name, last value, last change time, associate active event and trend view link for each tag. We can filter the content in the table by activating the Search, Time or Endpoint filters.

The Search filter enables to filter the tags in the table by a certain keyword. The Time filter lets the user to filter the tags by a certain time period predefined in the drop down list, or by entering a more specific time period by clicking on the <img src="/options_button.png" alt="last value logo" class = "logo_resize"> button. The Endpoint filter lets the user filter the tags by their endpoints. In most of the time the tags are enabled to constantly receive information, to view this changes the user must refresh the content in the table by clicking on the <img src="/refresh_button.png" alt="last value logo" class = "logo_resize"> button.

By clicking on the Active event icon in the table, QLARM will redirect the user to the Active event for that specific tag.
