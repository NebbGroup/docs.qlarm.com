By selecting a tag from the "Tag" filter (searchable drop down list), the table is filled with all the information associated with that tag. The table displays the time and value for each line of information. Additionally in the bottom left corner we have statistical information which displays the number of values, the minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation value of the Value column. This table can be refreshed to update its content and downloaded in .xlsx or .csv format. 

By clicking on the <img src="/history_filter_button.png" alt="last value logo" class = "logo_resize"> button the user can add or remove filters for the table content. Besides the default Tag filter, which is used to select a tag which content will be shown in the table, we have a "Group By" and "Time" filter. The "Group By" filter is used to group the table content by Hour or Day. This filter is accompanied with a "Function" filter which allows us to select which statistical information to be calculated for our grouped content.
