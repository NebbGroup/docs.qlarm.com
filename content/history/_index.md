By selecting a tag from the searchable drop down list, the table is filled with all the information associated with that tag. The table displays the time and value for each line of information. Additionally in the bottom left corner we have a stats content which displays the number of values, the minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation value. This table can be refreshed to update its content and downloaded in .xlsx or .csv format.
