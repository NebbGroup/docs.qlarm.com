### Default Dashboard

Upon logging into Qlarm a [Default Dashboard](/glossary#default-dashboard) is displayed. The Default Dashboard at first login is the "System Dashboard", but any other Dashboard that is available can be selected to be the new Default Dashboard by checking the "Default" checkbox <img src="/default_checkbox.png" alt="default checkbox">.


### Dashboard list
The "Dashboards" dropdown list allows you to select the Dashboard you want to view. All the available Dashboards are listed here, including the default "System Dashboard" and other Dashboards that are shared by other [Users](/glossary#user). You can always filter the list to view the custom Dashboards that are predefined in the system by checking "Mine" checkbox <img src="/mine_checkbox.png" alt="mine checkbox">. 


### Dashboard themes
The "Theme" dropdown list is used to select and change the visual colour of the Dashboard you are choosing to configure. By default, the light theme is selected, other themes, include the blue, dark and extra dark theme.


### Sharing a Dashboard
By checking the "Share" checkbox <img src="/share_checkbox.png" alt="share checkbox">, you can enable a selected Dashboard that you configured and share it with the other Users. Other users which can see the [endpoints](/endpoints-and-tags) used in the dashboard will see the dashboard in their Dashboards dropdown and will be able to make a copy of it or use it as their default dashboard
