Dashboards provide easy-to-read, easy access, real-time information about sensor values and process states which make the detection of both desired and undesired behaviors easier.
When you add a dashboard, you can choose to make it a project dashboard or one specific to a team. Use dashboards to display information or status about the project or when you want to control who can edit the dashboard. Use team dashboards to focus information specific to a team.
