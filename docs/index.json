	"content": "One of the most important features of QLARM is creating custom dashboards where you can display different custom configured widgets. Every configured dashboard can be named, configured, saved, reloaded when needed, set as default and shared with other participants.\rOverview At a glance, in the Dashboard View we are greeted with two components, the configuration header and display grid. The configuration header contains the important functionalities for configuring the dashboard. The display grid as it name suggest it displays the available dashboards that we selected from the configuration div and here we can configure the presentation and layout of the widgets in the dashboard. By default we are greeted with a default System Dashboard.\r\rFig 1. Dashboard configuration\r\rConfigure header The configuration header contains the main functionalities that lets us configure dashboards to our needs. In view mode we can view different dashboards that are available to us by changing them in the dashboard dropdown list. We can enter edit mode by clicking on the \"Configure\" button .\r\rFig 2. Configure header in view mode\r\rIn edit mode the configuration header is changed by adding new functionalities so we can configure dashboards.\nFig 3. Configure header in edit mode\r\rDashboard list The Dashboard drop down list lets us select the dashboard we need to view. Here are listed all the available dashboards to view, including the default System Dashboard and other users’ dashboards that are made available for sharing. We can always filter the list to view our custom dashboards by selecting the \"Mine\" checkbox . \rDashboard themes The theme dropdown list is used to select and change the visual color of the dashboard view we are configuring. By default, the light theme is selected, but there are other themes, including the blue, dark and extra dark theme.\r\rDefault Dashboard Upon opening QLARM a default dashboard is always displayed. By default, a System Dashboard is set to be the default dashboard but any other dashboard that is available can be set to be the new default dashboard by selecting the \"Default\" checkbox .\rSharing a Dashboard By checking the \"Share\" checkbox , we are enabling a selected dashboard that is configured by us to be shared to the other participants in the system.\r\rDashboard configuring The right cluster of buttons contains the main functionalities for configuring the dashboard we are working on.\r\rFig 4. Configure functionalities for dashboard\r\rNew Dashboard The \"New Dashboard\" button allows us to create a new dashboard. Upon clicking it, a new window is open to configure our new dashboard by naming it in the \"Dashboard Name\" field and adding custom widgets. \rFig 5. Configure functionalities for dashboard\r\rWhen a widget is clicked from the list it is shown on the grid panel, here we can rearrange them by dragging and dropping the widgets at the desired location on the grid and resize them by using the widget handle located in the lower right angle on every widget or by dragging and dropping the edges and corners. After configuring the dashboard layout we can click the \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button to save the dashboard or the \u0026ldquo;Cancel\u0026rdquo; button if we do not wish to save the dashboard.\nEvery widget can we configured by opening the widget menu and selecting “Edit Widget”. Here a new edit widget view is opened to configure the widget. Each widget has its own unique parameter for configuration (more on this in the Widgets subsection).\nFig 6. Widget components\r\rWe can saved the widget configuration by clicking the “Save” button , otherwise we can close this edit window by clicking the “Close” button .\nFig 7. Edit widget mode\r\rAfter configuring the widget, the Widget menu is updated with few more options, “Show Trend” and “Show Events” which are available to interact with depending on the circumstances.\nFig 8. Updated edit widget mode\r\rWidgets The widget list contains eight different types of widgets that can be add by clicking on any of them.\n Latest Value widget - shows the latest value of a desired sensor. In the \u0026ldquo;Subjects\u0026rdquo; tab we select an endpoint and tags available from that endpoint for which we wish to see the latest value. Here we can also give the widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value widgets. In the \u0026ldquo;Ranges\u0026rdquo; tab we adjust custom ranges with whom we will view the latest value in a certain color if it falls in that range. The \u0026ldquo;Labels\u0026rdquo; tab contains additional settings for configuring the widget.  Fig 8. Last value widget menu\r\r Latest Value Gauge - shows the latest value of a desired sensor using a gauge with custom range values and colors, Tag state - shows the state of a desired sensor by setting custom range values and different colors, Tag chart - displays tag values for a desired period with a chart, Elapsed time for endpoint - displays the time since last event/data for an endpoint, Elapsed time for system - displays the time since last event/data for the system, Endpoint state - shows the current connection state of an endpoint, System status - shows the system cumulative health status of all endpoints states.  Save Dashboard When we have made all the desired configurations in the dashboard we can save it buy clicking on the \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button .\nAdd Widget The \u0026ldquo;Add Widget\u0026rdquo; button allows us to add additional widgets to our dashboard. By clicking the button we are greeted with the same window as if we were creating a new dashboard.\nDiscard Dashboard The \u0026ldquo;Discard\u0026rdquo; button discards all of the applied changes we did in the dashboard we are configuring.\nDelete Dashboard The \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; button deletes the selected dashboard that we have configured.\nExit Dashboard The \u0026ldquo;Exit\u0026rdquo; button allows us to leave the edit mode and get back to the view mode.\nGrid panel The grid panel displays the configured dashboards by laying out the saved configured widgets. It is here where we can rearrange and resize each widget.\n"

	"content": "Event view is listing the current and the past events in tabs Events and History, respectively. Sorting on column and various filtering are provided for both tabs. Events tab events have details provided in collapsible row and can be edited. Both Events and History data have Logs.\rFig 1. Events\r\rTypes of Events There are two types of alarms defined in the system now: Alarm and Other. The functional flow for the Alarm type events is: An event instance (Alarm) is Created and then it gets the Creation Date. If there is a grace period defined in the Custom Event, then the event instance is Activated after this grace period. And if not it is activated right after it is created and then it gets the Activation Date. If the reason for the Alarm is gone (the new evaluation does not satisfy the Alarm condition, e.g. the freezer got cold enough again) than the Alarm gets Inactivated if it is in a grace period and then it gets the Inactive Date and Archived if it is in a grace period and then it gets the Archived Date. If the Alarm is Acknowledged by a user, active or inactive, then it gets the Acknowledged date. Every time a real-world alarm happens, before the creation of an alarm in the system, we find the old inactive alarms for the Custom Event (acknowledged or not) and we archive them, then they get the Archived date. Custom Event can be edited or deleted. Alarms that happen because of it are Archived, then they get the Archived date. The functional flow for the Other type events is: An event instance (Event) is Created and then it gets the Creation Date. If there is a grace period defined in the Custom Event, then the event instance is Activated after this grace period. And if not it is activated right after it is created and then it gets the Activation Date. If the reason for the Event is gone (the new evaluation does not satisfy the Event condition) than the Event gets Archived, then it gets the Archived Date. Custom Event can be edited or deleted. Alarms that happen because of it are Archived, then they get the Archived date.\nColumns According to the explanation above, for Alarm we can expect:\n Creation time Activation time Inactive time Acknowledged time Archived time  And for Other type of event we can expect:\n Creation time Activation time Archived time  They both have State : In grace period or not, and that only depend of the time passed since creation.\nFilters There are filters on this page mutual for both tabs (Events and History):\n \u0026ldquo;ENDPOINT FILTER\u0026rdquo; - This filter is preselected and it filters events for selected endpoint. \u0026ldquo;TAG FILTER\u0026rdquo; - This filter is populated with the selected endpoint tags and is not preselected. It filters events for selected tag. \u0026ldquo;SEARCH FILTER\u0026rdquo; (by name) - This filters events by name that contains the search string. \u0026ldquo;EVENT TYPE\u0026rdquo; - This filters only the events from selected type. \u0026ldquo;IN GRACE PERIOD\u0026rdquo; - If this is checked than only events that are in grace period will be displayed. Otherwise only the events that are not in a grace period are listed.  For Events tab we have\n  \u0026ldquo;EVENT STATE\u0026rdquo; - This filters the events that have the selected event state.\n  \u0026ldquo;ACKNOWLEDGED STATE\u0026rdquo; - This filters the events that have the selected acknowledged state.\n  There is also \u0026ldquo;DATE FILTER\u0026rdquo; that is available for the History tab, and it filters the events by creation date.\n  Depending on what is chosen in the filters we have a different display of columns: If data is expected for a column for a certain filter combination, than the column is displayed.\nInfo in columns (cells population) If data is not expected than \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; is displayed. If data is expected but not available then an empty cell is displayed.\nEvents details (click on the arrow at the beginning of the row) If data is not expected than the label for a certain time is not displayed.\nIf data is expected but not available then \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; is displayed.\nSorting Sorting by clicking on a column name in the tables in both tabs is provided.\nEvent view Edit Events listed in the Event view tab can be edited by clicking the row context menu and than chose \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo;. Logs Events listed in both Event view and History tab have logs provided. They can be reached by clicking the row context menu and than choose \u0026ldquo;Logs\u0026rdquo;. Logs display tracking data about the event. What has happen, when and by who. There is also a possibility for a user to add a custom log (a comment). Event view Actions Event view events can be acknowledged from this view by clicking the relevant row \u0026ldquo;ACK\u0026rdquo; button. Than popup appears and we need to confirm if we acknowledge the event or we can cancel the acknowledgement.\nEvent view Links Event view events are related to tags which data can be visually presented in a chart in Trend view. Link to this page is available in Trend column. "
