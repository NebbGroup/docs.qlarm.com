	"content": "Qlarm Dashboards are designed to display the custom Dashboards along with various configured Widget. It is highly flexible and enables you to create your own Dashboards and share between other Dashboard viewers. Qlarm comes with a variety of configurable Widgets that you can use to build a specific Dashboard view that meets the different needs of your business. They provide you real-time monitoring of sensor values with configurable states which makes the detection of desired on undesired behaviors much more easier.\rOverview The Dashboard View contains two main components, configuration header and display grid. The configuration header contains essential functionalities for Dashboard configuration which can be accessed by clicking the button. The display grid displays the available Dashboards that can be selected from the Dashboards list, and there you can configure the presentation and layout of the Widgets within the selected Dashboard.\nFig 1. Dashboard configuration\r\r\u0026times;\r\r\rWorking with Dashboards In the following sections, the two main functionalities of Qlarm Dashboards are explained:\n Viewing Dashboards Managing Dashboards  Viewing Dashboards Default Dashboard Upon logging into Qlarm a Default Dashboard is displayed. The Default Dashboard at first login is the \u0026ldquo;System Dashboard\u0026rdquo;, but any other Dashboard that is available can be selected to be the new Default Dashboard by checking the \u0026ldquo;Default\u0026rdquo; checkbox .\nDashboard list The \u0026ldquo;Dashboards\u0026rdquo; dropdown list allows you to select the Dashboard you want to view. All the available Dashboards are listed here, including the default \u0026ldquo;System Dashboard\u0026rdquo; and other Dashboards that are shared by other Users. You can always filter the list to view the custom Dashboards that are predefined in the system by checking \u0026ldquo;Mine\u0026rdquo; checkbox .\nDashboard themes The \u0026ldquo;Theme\u0026rdquo; dropdown list is used to select and change the visual colour of the Dashboard you are choosing to configure. By default, the light theme is selected, other themes, include the blue, dark and extra dark theme.\nSharing a Dashboard By checking the \u0026ldquo;Share\u0026rdquo; checkbox , you can enable a selected Dashboard that you configured and share it with the other Users.\nManaging Dashboards Configure header The configuration header contains the main functionalities that allow you to configure Dashboards to your needs. In view mode, you can view different Dashboards that are available, and you can change them from the \u0026ldquo;Dashboards\u0026rdquo; dropdown list. You can enter edit mode by clicking the button.\nFig 2. Configure header in view mode\r\rIn edit mode the configuration header is changed by adding new functionalities so you can configure Dashboards.\nFig 3. Configure header in edit mode\r\rDashboard configuration The right cluster of buttons contains the main functionalities for configuring the Dashboard you are working on.\nFig 4. Configure functionalities for dashboard\r\rNew Dashboard and Add Widgets The \u0026ldquo;New Dashboard\u0026rdquo; button allows you to create a new Dashboard. When you go to New Dashboard, a new window opens to configure your new Dashboard. You can select a name for it under the \u0026ldquo;Dashboard Name\u0026rdquo; field and add custom Widgets.\nFig 5. Creating a new dashboard\r\rWhen you select a Widget from the list, it is shown on the grid panel. To organize the widgets in the grip panel you can drag and drop them to the desired location and order. To resize a Widget, use the Widget handle located in the lower right corner on every Widget or by drag and drop edges and corners. After configuring the Dashboard layout you can click the button to save the Dashboard or the button if you do not want to save the Dashboard. Afterwards, if you need to add additional Widgets to the Dashboard, you only need to click the button by which you are greeted with the same window as if you were creating a new Dashboard.\nAll Widgets can be configured by clicking the configure button visible for any un-configured widget on the dashboard or by opening the Widget Menu and selecting “Edit Widget”. An edit widget form opens for you to configure it. Every Widget has its own unique configuration parameter (more on this in the Widgets subsection).\nFig 6. Widget configure button\r\r\rFig 7. Widget components\r\r\r\rYou can save the Widget configuration by clicking the button, or you can close the edit window by clicking the button.\nFig 8. Edit widget mode\r\rWhen the Widget configuration is complete, the Widget Menu is updated with the new options defined by the Widget.\nWidgets The Widget List contains eight different types of Widgets that can be added one by one from the list.\n Endpoints Map Widget - shows the precise location of the given endpoints that you have access to. Each endpoint is represented with a pin, which changes color depending of the availability status of the endpoint, \u0026ldquo;Offline\u0026rdquo; state is colored in red meaning the endpoint is unavailable and \u0026ldquo;Online\u0026rdquo; state colored in green meaning the endpoint is up and running. Navigation through the widget is simple by dragging the with the cursor and zooming in and out using the mouse scroll. When hovering over a specific endpoint pin, an information bubble appears that contains basic information about the endpoint: Name, Description, Status and Location. when editing the Endpoints Map widget, by checking the first checkbox you can set the precise zoom level and location upon which you want to view when logging in to Qlarm or navigating to dashboard view.  Fig 9. Endpoints map menu\r\r Latest Value Widget - shows the latest value of a selected sensor. In the “Subjects” tab you can select an Endpoint and Tags available from that Endpoint for which you want to see the latest value. You can also give the Widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value Widgets. In the “Ranges” tab you can adjust custom ranges to view the latest value in a certain colour, if it falls in that range. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for Widget configuration.  Fig 10. Last value widget menu\r\r Latest Value Gauge - shows the latest value of a selected sensor using a gauge with custom range values and colours. In the “Subjects” tab you can select an Endpoint and Tags available from that Endpoint for which you want to see the latest value. You can also give the Widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value Gauge Widgets. In the “Ranges” tab you can adjust the appearance of the gauge. First you need to set the minimum and maximum value and the base colour of the scale. Then you can add custom ranges on the scale to view the latest value in a certain colour, if it falls in that range. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for Widget configuration.  Fig 11. Last value gauge widget menu\r\r Tag State - shows the state of a selected sensor by setting custom range values and different colours. In the “Subjects” tab you can select an Endpoint and Tags available from that Endpoint for which you want to see the Tag State. You can also give the Widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value Widgets. In the “States” tab you can adjust custom ranges to view the Tag State in a certain colour, if it falls in that range. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for Widget configuration.  Fig 12. Tag State widget menu\r\r Tag Chart - displays the values of the selected Tag for a specified time period. The values in this widget are downsampled, grouped in short intervals, to optimize the performance of the application. This widget supports live tracking for time periods shorter than a day and statistical analysis for periods longer than a day, which can be set in the edit menu. When editing the widget, in the “Subjects” tab you can select an Endpoint and Tags available from that Endpoint for which you want to see the Tag Chart. You can also give the Widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value Widgets. In the “Interval” tab you can adjust the time unit type, number of time units and the display color. When selecting the time unit type, if you select \u0026ldquo;Hour\u0026rdquo; and enter a number of time units less or equal to 24, this sets the live tracking mode for the tag chart widget, which means the graph will be updated whenever the Tag records new values. When selecting other time units: \u0026ldquo;Day\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Week\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Month\u0026rdquo;; we can enable Max interval, Min interval and Basic Statistics which can be set in the \u0026ldquo;Labels\u0026rdquo; tab. The Max and Min interval are an addition to the main interval line, which represent the highest and lowest value in the grouped interval. The Basic statistics label calculates the: \u0026ldquo;Average\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Maximum\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Minimum\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Standard Deviation\u0026rdquo;; for the specified time period. Also, whenever you interact with the widget, by zooming in our out the graph, the basic statistic label gets updated for the selected time period.  Fig 13. Tag Chart widget menu\r\r Elapsed time for Endpoint - displays latest log Events from the Endpoint. In the “Subjects” tab you can select an Endpoint to see the elapsed time. In the “Data” and “Event” tabs you can add intervals with different ranges and colours that represent the “Last Data” and “Last Event”. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for Widget configuration.  Fig 14. Elapsed time for endpoint widget menu\r\r Elapsed time for system - displays latest log Events in the system. Go to “Subjects” tab and select an Endpoint to see the elapsed time. In the “Data” and “Event” tabs you can add intervals with different ranges and colours to represent the “Last Data” and “Last Event”. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for Widget configuration.  Fig 15. Elapsed time for system widget menu\r\r Endpoint state - shows the current connection state of an Endpoint. In the “Subject” tab you can select an Endpoint to monitor its state. In the \u0026ldquo;States\u0026rdquo; tab you can add colours for the \u0026ldquo;ONLINE\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;OFFLINE\u0026rdquo; status. The \u0026ldquo;Labels\u0026rdquo; tab contains additional settings for configuring the Widget.  Fig 16. Endpoint state widget menu\r\r System status - shows the system cumulative health status for all endpoints states. Go to “Statuses” tab to add colours for the “OK”, “BROKEN” and “SYSTEM SHUTDOWN” status. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for Widget configuration.  Fig 17. System status widget menu\r\rSave Dashboard To keep the changes in the Dashboard you can save the configurations by clicking on the button.\nDiscard Dashboard The button discards all the applied changes you did in the Dashboard you are configuring.\nDelete Dashboard The button deletes the selected Dashboard that you have configured.\nCopy Dashboard Whenever you are viewing a Dashboard created by another User, you can copy the existing Dashboard by clicking on the button. This will ask you if you want to rename the Dashboard and save the copy as your own after clicking the button.\nFig 18.

	"content": "\u0026times;\r\r\rThe \u0026ldquo;Events\u0026rdquo; page shows the current status and history of Event Instances. The event lists can be filtered to display events in several different ways. The \u0026ldquo;Event View\u0026rdquo; tab lists the currently active Events, and inactive Events that have not been acknowledged. The \u0026ldquo;History\u0026rdquo; tab lists all Events that are both inactive and acknowledged.\nThe Event Definitions can be edited for each instance, and the Logs containing all the changes the event states pass through can be accessed.\rFig 1. Events\r\rTypes of Events There are two Event Types defined in the system: Alarm and Other. The functional flow for the Alarm type of Events is:\nAn Event Instance (Alarm) is Created and assigned a Creation Date. If there is a Grace Period defined in the Event Definition, the Event Instance is Activated after the Grace Period expires. If no Grace Period is defined, it is activated immediately. If the new evaluation does not meet the Alarm Condition, the Alarm is Inactivated if it is not in a Grace Period (Inactive Date). If it is in a Grace Period it is Archived. Both active and inactive Event Instances can be Acknowledged by a Recipient. Every time a Condition is met, before the creation of an Event Instance, system finds the old inactive Alarm for the Event Definition (acknowledged or not) and archives it . Event Definitions can be edited or deleted. In this case its instances are Archived. The functional flow for the Other type of Events is:\nAn Event Instance is Created. If there is a Grace Period defined in the Event Definition, the Event Instance is Activated after the Grace Period expires. If no Grace Period is defined, it is activated immediately. If the new evaluation does not meet the Condition, the Event Instance are Archived. Event Definition can be edited or deleted. In this case its instances are Archived.\nColumns Columns common for all Event Types are:\n   Column Name Value     State Active or Inactive   Timer Time elapsed since Activation   Type Alarm or Other   Creation Time Timestamp for creation   Active Time Timestamp for transition to Active state   Inactive Time Timestamp for transition to Inactive state   Ack Time Timestamp for Acknowledgement of Alarm   Trend Link to trend view   Actions Button for Acknowledging Alarm    Filters The following filters are available for both Events and History tabs:\n \u0026ldquo;ENDPOINT FILTER\u0026rdquo; - the endpoint filter is preselected and is used to select Event Instances created for any of the Tags of the selected Endpoint. \u0026ldquo;TAG FILTER\u0026rdquo; - the tag filter is populated with the selected Endpoint Tags and is not preselected. It filters Event Instances for selected Tag. \u0026ldquo;SEARCH FILTER\u0026rdquo; (by name) - filters the Event Instances with a name that contains the search string. \u0026ldquo;EVENT TYPE\u0026rdquo; - filters only the Event Instances from selected Event Type. \u0026ldquo;IN GRACE PERIOD\u0026rdquo; - If checked, only Event Instances that are in Grace Period will be displayed .  In the Events tab there are also:\n \u0026ldquo;EVENT STATE\u0026rdquo; - filters the Event Instances that have the selected event state. \u0026ldquo;ACKNOWLEDGED STATE\u0026rdquo; - filters the Event Instances that have the selected acknowledged state.

An Event Definition define the specifig tags the system should supervise. Setting Conditions on tags enables the Event to become Active and notifcations to be raised whenever the value of those tags exceed some defined boundaries. The Event Definition also enables you to define which Recipients the notifications are to be sent, and whether to notify them via email, phone or push notifications.\rFig 1. Events configuration\r\rType of the Event Definition, number of Recipients and if the event definition is enabled, are information displayed in the table. Event Definitions can be created , duplicated , edited and deleted . Event Definitions can be searched by name or filtered by Endpoint by the filters provided.\nFig 2. Events filter options\r\rAdd event If you click on the \u0026ldquo;Add event\u0026rdquo; button \u0026ldquo;Add event\u0026rdquo; popup is opened.\nFig 3. Add event\r\rAs for the Event Definition it self, \u0026ldquo;NAME\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;DESCRIPTION\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;TYPE\u0026rdquo; info should be populated and the event should be enabled if you want it to take the set Actions for the Condition set. There are two types of Event Definitions: Alarm and Other. Alarms can be acknowledged and can became active and inactive depending of the latest value. Other type of Event Definition just gets archived when the Condition is not met (See Event View page for more details).\nFig 4. General event info\r\rCondition \u0026ldquo;Condition\u0026rdquo; tab is preselected when you open the \u0026ldquo;Add event\u0026rdquo; popup. A Condition must be set in order for the Event Instance to be created. You should choose one \u0026ldquo;ENDPOINT\u0026rdquo;, and one or many Tags from \u0026ldquo;TAG\u0026rdquo; list to create a Condition, and compose the actual Condition forthe Tag\u0026rsquo;s value. You can add two types of conditions: Condition for the tag value and condition for the not having a value for tag for certain period of time. When you add a condition for the tag value, you can set that the value is equal to, or greater than, or less than, or equal to or greater than, or less than or equal to the value you set in the \u0026ldquo;VALUE\u0026rdquo; field. E.g. If you want an event to be raised when the temperature of a fridge raise over 10 degrees, you will create condition with selecting \u0026ldquo;Value\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;CRITERIA\u0026rdquo;, selecting \u0026ldquo;Greater than\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;OPERATOR\u0026rdquo; and write down \u0026ldquo;10\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;VALUE\u0026rdquo; input field. When you add a condition for the not having a value for tag for certain period of time i.e. you want an event to be raised when tag has stopped sending values for e.g. 15 minutes, you will create condition with selecting \u0026ldquo;Time\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;CRITERIA\u0026rdquo;, selecting \u0026ldquo;No value in period of\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;OPERATOR\u0026rdquo; and write down \u0026ldquo;15\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;VALUE (MIN)\u0026rdquo; input field. Minimum value for not having tag values received is 5 minutes. If the Event Definition is created for many Tags, the Tag that will raise this Event is the Activation Tag which name is used in the display of the name of the Event Instance, listed in the Event View page.\nFig 5. Event condition\r\rAfter a Condition is created it is listed in the table below and can be edited and deleted .\nFig 6. Edit event condition\r\rActions Actions can be defined in the tab \u0026ldquo;Actions\u0026rdquo; . These are notifications that need to be sent in chosen ways to chosen Recipients, with custom content, if the Event Definition Condition is met.  To create an \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo;, select type \u0026ldquo;Notification\u0026rdquo; from the \u0026ldquo;TYPE\u0026rdquo; dropdown.

You can play/stop the \u0026ldquo;VOICE MESSAGE TEXT\u0026rdquo; to check the whole message that will be played to the Recipient in the Call Notification.  Recipients can be added one by one or as a Recipients Group from the \u0026ldquo;RECIPIENTS\u0026rdquo; dropdown.  Notification can be repeated in the number of times set in the \u0026ldquo;REPEAT\u0026rdquo; textbox. In \u0026ldquo;INTERVAL (MIN)\u0026rdquo; you can define the interval between the notifications if they need to be repeated. In \u0026ldquo;PAUSE FOR NEXT ACTION (MIN)\u0026rdquo; you can define the interval between the Actions if they need to be looped (see \u0026ldquo;EXECUTION\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;Advanced settings\u0026rdquo; for more details).\nFig 7.

In \u0026ldquo;EXECUTION\u0026rdquo; you can define if Actions should execute \u0026ldquo;Once\u0026rdquo; or many times in \u0026ldquo;Loop\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;BREAK WHEN EVENT BECOMES\u0026rdquo; Inactive or Acknowledged refers to stopping the notifications set to be repeated and all Actions set to be executed again.\nTemplates management While you add or edit Custom Event you can help yourself creating notification content with choosing a Template. You can use it directly as it is or to change the text for immediate usage. You can add, edit or delete Templates, and use them as such immediate or later when you or other user will add or edit event. Text message template is used for setting E-mail, SMS and Push notifications text. And Voice message template is used for the Voice messages.\nUnder the Add/Edit Event there is a possibility to manage Templates. You can enter in this mode via clicking the toggle button on the right side of the Template dropdown list.\n\u0026lt;figure class=\u0026quot;image_container\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;img class=\u0026quot;center_image myImg\u0026quot; onClick=\u0026quot;reply_click(this)\u0026quot; id=\u0026quot;manage_templates_toggle_button\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;/manage_templates_toggle_button.png\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;Manage templates toggle button\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;figcaption\u0026gt;Fig 10.

	"content": "Account Refers to one or more accounts within Qlarm, but typically the Tenant. Other types of accounts are User account.\nAction An activity to be carried out by the system when the condition of an event becomes true. An event may have multiple actions, and they can be executed once or repeatedly depending on configuration.\nAction Type A type of Action. Currently there is only Notification implemented, but in the future there will be a multitude of Action Types available.\nAcknowledge (synonym: ACK) An activity by a user or a recipient to confirm that they have seen an event and take responsibility to follow up on the corresponding event.\nAlarm An alarm is a type of event within Qlarm. It has a stricter set of parameters, and is acknowledgeable.\nAsset A collection of tags, events, states and attributes that belong to a single entity within the system. An asset provides context to the system. A sensor is typically not an asset, but a device that provides data on behalf of an asset. E.g. a motor [asset] could have tags for Speed, Power, and Temperature; and static attributes Name, Weight, and Location; and have an event (alarm) defined for Overheating. Assets can share properties through templates.\nAsset model An hierarchical representation (model) of assets.\nChannel A method or mechanism of communicating with recipients. E.g. SMS text message, e-mail, voice phone call or push notifications.\nCondition A rule within an event that evaluates to true or false for the attributes of a tag (its value, quality, or time). Example:\nRoom temperature is less than 30 °C [RoomTemp \u0026lt; 30].\nFreezer temperature is greater than -20 °C [FreezerTemp \u0026gt; -20]\nContext tag The tag within an event that triggered the event.\nDashboard A graphical representation of the real time content within Qlarm. The dashboard is composed of customizable widgets showing data like values, states, graphs.\nDefault dashboard The dashboard configuration which loads when Dashboard page is opened.\nEdge Client The Qlarm Edge Client is an application (service) running on the local server of a customer. The Edge Client acts as an intermediary broker between the Qlarm platform and the local data source. The Edge Client will monitor an OPC UA server locally and forward data depending on the configuration and the customer\u0026rsquo;s subscription.\nEndpoint A connection to a data source from where to get data. The endpoint can be of types OPC UA (using the Qlarm Edge Client); IoT Gateway (using MQTT directly). An endpoint belongs to a tenant and has a separate Scope defined. Endpoints have a number of tags defined, and attributes like Location, Time Zone, Geographic properties.\nEvent An occurrence defined by a given condition and corresponding actions.\nExamples:\nCondition: Room temperature is over 30 °C\nAction: Send an SMS to the janitor.\nEvent Definition The definition of an event with its name, conditions, actions, and parameters. Found under Qlarm -\u0026gt; Configuration -\u0026gt; Events.\nEvent Instance When an event has been triggered, an Event Instance is created. The Event Instance will remain active until the event condition reverts to false. There can only be one Event Instance active at any time (see Tag Set). An event instance can have these states:\n Created - when the condition becomes true; In Grace Period - a defined waiting period before any actions are executed; Active - after the grace period and when the actions are executed; Active \u0026amp; Unacknowledged - the user has not yet acknowledged the event instance; Active \u0026amp; Acknowledged - the user has acknowledged the event instance; Inactive - when the condition no longer is true (no actions executed if turning inactive during grace period); Inactive \u0026amp; Unacknowledged - the condition is no longer true and the user has not acknowledged; Archived - when event is inactive and no pending user activities pending (e.g. acknowledge);  Event Type Events inherit some features by their type. Currently there are only two system defined types: Alarm and Other. Alarms can be acknowledged, Other can not. In the future more types can be created and customized by the user.\nGrace period The time in minutes to ignore an event\u0026rsquo;s condition. The purpose is to filter out or allow a certain overshoot of a tag\u0026rsquo;s value. This is an advanced setting of an event.\nLogs Tracking information data about changes made to an entity (Event, Endpoint, etc.).\nMQTT A standard messaging protocol for Internet of Things (IoT). Used for IoT endpoints to communicate between Qlarm and the local gateway.\nNotification A message sent from Qlarm to notify recipients through one or more channels (SMS, voice call, e-mail or push notification). Typically defined as an action on an event.\nOPC server OPC is an industrial automation communication protocol. An OPC server define items/tags that can be read by the Qlarm Edge Client and forwarded to the Qlarm platform.\nPage size The number of items (rows) to be listed in a table. There is a feature at the bottom of the table to browse to the next or previous pages.\nPermission A restriction rule for User action.\nPortal The online web application of Qlarm found on app.qlarm.com.\nRecipient A person that can receive notifications from Qlarm. A recipient is not necessarily a user, but can be.\nRecipients Group A group of recipients.\nReport A trending chart displaying values of one or more tags in time.\nRole A set of permissions providing or denying access to features or activities within the system. Users have one role per tenant.\nScope A limitation of the data users have access to. An endpoint will be automatically created with a data access limitation called \u0026ldquo;scope\u0026rdquo;. A user can have access to one or more scopes. A user can only access the data of the scopes they have access to. They will not see the Endpoints, Dashboards, or any other elements using data from other scopes. An administrator can define who has access to which scopes.\nSite menu The menu tree on the left side that organizes pages.\nSite menu items The items of the Site menu which are links to pages or submenus.\nSubscription An agreement and payment plan defining the features and capabilities of Qlarm for the customer. A subscription belongs to a tenant.\nTag One specific data point. E.g. a temperature.\nTag Set A group of tags defined within one event that share the same conditions and actions. Event instances are created individually for each tag.\nTenant (account) A tenant is similar to a customer account, and often just referred to as the Account. A tenant defines the properties of the customer, the subscription, the endpoints and the users that have access to Qlarm.\nTicket An issue from a person about the system provided to system support.\nTime zone Time zones are defined for both the user and the endpoint, as well as Qlarm internally handing all times as UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). Qlarm will always present data to the user in the user\u0026rsquo;s time zone (and time format) when in the portal, unless explicitly instructed otherwise. This enables the possibility to compare data between endpoints in different time zones. It is important to note that the time shown in notifications for recipients will be in the endpoint\u0026rsquo;s time zone (and the tenants time format) as there are no time zones defined for recipients.\u0026quot;\nTrend A chart that shows the historic values of one or more tags in the form of a graph. The x-axis is time and the y-axis the value.\nTrigger The condition of an event is also called a trigger. When the condition is true the event has been triggered and an Event Instance is created.\nUser A person who has access to the Qlarm system. A user may have access to one or more tenants.\nView One of the \u0026ldquo;pages\u0026rdquo; in the system providing a view/perspective to the data. E.g. Live View, Events View, History View, Trend View.\nWidget A configurable component on the dashboard which provides real-time values about tags, endpoints and the system.\n"
