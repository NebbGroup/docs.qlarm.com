	"content": "One of the most important features of QLARM is creating custom dashboards where you can display different custom configured widgets. Every configured dashboard can be named, configured, saved, reloaded when needed, set as default and shared with other participants.\rOverview At a glance, in the Dashboard View we are greeted with two components, the configuration header and display grid. The configuration header contains the important functionalities for configuring the dashboard. The display grid as it name suggest it displays the available dashboards that we selected from the configuration div and here we can configure the presentation and layout of the widgets in the dashboard. By default we are greeted with a default System Dashboard.\r\rFig 1. Dashboard configuration\r\rConfigure header The configuration header contains the main functionalities that lets us configure dashboards to our needs. In view mode we can view different dashboards that are available to us by changing them in the dashboard dropdown list. We can enter edit mode by clicking on the \"Configure\" button .\r\rFig 2. Configure header in view mode\r\rIn edit mode the configuration header is changed by adding new functionalities so we can configure dashboards.\nFig 3. Configure header in edit mode\r\rDashboard list The Dashboard drop down list lets us select the dashboard we need to view. Here are listed all the available dashboards to view, including the default System Dashboard and other users’ dashboards that are made available for sharing. We can always filter the list to view our custom dashboards by selecting the \"Mine\" checkbox . \rDashboard themes The theme dropdown list is used to select and change the visual color of the dashboard view we are configuring. By default, the light theme is selected, but there are other themes, including the blue, dark and extra dark theme.\r\rDefault Dashboard Upon opening QLARM a default dashboard is always displayed. By default, a System Dashboard is set to be the default dashboard but any other dashboard that is available can be set to be the new default dashboard by selecting the \"Default\" checkbox .\rSharing a Dashboard By checking the \"Share\" checkbox , we are enabling a selected dashboard that is configured by us to be shared to the other participants in the system.\r\rDashboard configuring The right cluster of buttons contains the main functionalities for configuring the dashboard we are working on.\r\rFig 4. Configure functionalities for dashboard\r\rNew Dashboard The \"New Dashboard\" button allows us to create a new dashboard. Upon clicking it, a new window is open to configure our new dashboard by naming it in the \"Dashboard Name\" field and adding custom widgets. \rFig 5. Configure functionalities for dashboard\r\rWhen a widget is clicked from the list it is shown on the grid panel, here we can rearrange them by dragging and dropping the widgets at the desired location on the grid and resize them by using the widget handle located in the lower right angle on every widget or by dragging and dropping the edges and corners. After configuring the dashboard layout we can click the \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button to save the dashboard or the \u0026ldquo;Cancel\u0026rdquo; button if we do not wish to save the dashboard.\nEvery widget can we configured by opening the widget menu and selecting “Edit Widget”. Here a new edit widget view is opened to configure the widget. Each widget has its own unique parameter for configuration (more on this in the Widgets subsection).\nFig 6. Widget components\r\rWe can saved the widget configuration by clicking the “Save” button , otherwise we can close this edit window by clicking the “Close” button .\nFig 7. Edit widget mode\r\rAfter configuring the widget, the Widget menu is updated with few more options depending on the widget.\nWidgets The widget list contains eight different types of widgets that can be add by clicking on any of them.\n Latest Value widget - shows the latest value of a desired sensor. In the \u0026ldquo;Subjects\u0026rdquo; tab we select an endpoint and tags available from that endpoint for which we wish to see the latest value. Here we can also give the widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value widgets. In the \u0026ldquo;Ranges\u0026rdquo; tab we adjust custom ranges with whom we will view the latest value in a certain color if it falls in that range. The \u0026ldquo;Labels\u0026rdquo; tab contains additional settings for configuring the widget.  Fig 8. Last value widget menu\r\r Latest Value Gauge - shows the latest value of a desired sensor using a gauge with custom range values and colors. In the \u0026ldquo;Subjects\u0026rdquo; tab we select an endpoint and tags available from that endpoint for which we wish to see the latest value. Here we can also give the widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value Gauge widgets. In the \u0026ldquo;Ranges\u0026rdquo; tab we adjust the appearance of the gauge. Here first we set the minimum and maximum value and the base color of the scale. Then we can add custom ranges on the scale with whom we will view the latest value in a certain color if it falls in that range. The \u0026ldquo;Labels\u0026rdquo; tab contains additional settings for configuring the widget.  Fig 9. Last value widget menu\r\r Tag state - shows the state of a desired sensor by setting custom range values and different colors. In the \u0026ldquo;Subjects\u0026rdquo; tab we select an endpoint and tags available from that endpoint for which we wish to see the tag state. Here we can also give the widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value widgets. In the \u0026ldquo;States\u0026rdquo; tab we adjust custom ranges with whom we will view the tag state in a certain color if it falls in that range. The \u0026ldquo;Labels\u0026rdquo; tab contains additional settings for configuring the widget.  Fig 10. Last value widget menu\r\r Tag chart - displays tag values for a desired period with a chart. In the \u0026ldquo;Subjects\u0026rdquo; tab we select an endpoint and tags available from that endpoint for which we wish to see the tag chart. Here we can also give the widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value widgets. In the \u0026ldquo;Interval\u0026rdquo; tab we adjust the unit of time, number and color of the time units. The \u0026ldquo;Labels\u0026rdquo; tab contains additional settings for configuring the widget.  Fig 10. Last value widget menu\r\r Elapsed time for endpoint - displays the time since last event/data for an endpoint. In the \u0026ldquo;Subjects\u0026rdquo; tab we select an endpoint for which we wish to see the elapsed time. In the \u0026ldquo;Data\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Event\u0026rdquo; tabs we add intervals with different ranges and colors to represent the \u0026ldquo;Last Data\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Last Event\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;Labels\u0026rdquo; tab contains additional settings for configuring the widget.  Fig 10. Last value widget menu\r\r Elapsed time for system - displays the time since last event/data for the system. In the \u0026ldquo;Subjects\u0026rdquo; tab we select an endpoint for which we wish to see the elapsed time. In the \u0026ldquo;Data\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Event\u0026rdquo; tabs we add intervals with different ranges and colors to represent the \u0026ldquo;Last Data\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Last Event\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;Labels\u0026rdquo; tab contains additional settings for configuring the widget.  Fig 10. Last value widget menu\r\r Endpoint state - shows the current connection state of an endpoint. In the \u0026ldquo;Subject\u0026rdquo; tab we select an endpoint for which we wish to see its state. In the \u0026ldquo;States\u0026rdquo; tab we add colors for the \u0026ldquo;ONLINE\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;OFFLINE\u0026rdquo; status. The \u0026ldquo;Labels\u0026rdquo; tab contains additional settings for configuring the widget.  Fig 10. Last value widget menu\r\r System status - shows the system cumulative health status of all endpoints states. In the \u0026ldquo;Statuses\u0026rdquo; tab we add colors for the \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;BROKEN\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;SYSTEM SHUTDOWN\u0026rdquo; status. The \u0026ldquo;Labels\u0026rdquo; tab contains additional settings for configuring the widget.  Fig 10.

	"content": "Event view is listing the current and the past events in tabs Events and History, respectively. Sorting on column and various filtering are provided for both tabs. Events tab events have details provided in collapsible row and can be edited. Both Events and History data have Logs.\rIf the event optains many tags then the name displayed for the event is consisted of the tag name dash (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;) the the name of the custom event.\nFig 1. Events\r\rTypes of Events There are two types of alarms defined in the system now: Alarm and Other. The functional flow for the Alarm type events is: An event instance (Alarm) is Created and then it gets the Creation Date. If there is a grace period defined in the Custom Event, then the event instance is Activated after this grace period. And if not it is activated right after it is created and then it gets the Activation Date. If the reason for the Alarm is gone (the new evaluation does not satisfy the Alarm condition, e.g. the freezer got cold enough again) than the Alarm gets Inactivated if it is in a grace period and then it gets the Inactive Date and Archived if it is in a grace period and then it gets the Archived Date. If the Alarm is Acknowledged by a user, active or inactive, then it gets the Acknowledged date. Every time a real-world alarm happens, before the creation of an alarm in the system, we find the old inactive alarms for the Custom Event (acknowledged or not) and we archive them, then they get the Archived date. Custom Event can be edited or deleted. Alarms that happen because of it are Archived, then they get the Archived date. The functional flow for the Other type events is: An event instance (Event) is Created and then it gets the Creation Date. If there is a grace period defined in the Custom Event, then the event instance is Activated after this grace period. And if not it is activated right after it is created and then it gets the Activation Date. If the reason for the Event is gone (the new evaluation does not satisfy the Event condition) than the Event gets Archived, then it gets the Archived Date. Custom Event can be edited or deleted. Alarms that happen because of it are Archived, then they get the Archived date.\nColumns According to the explanation above, for Alarm we can expect:\n Creation time Activation time Inactive time Acknowledged time Archived time  And for Other type of event we can expect:\n Creation time Activation time Archived time  They both have State : In grace period or not, and that only depend of the time passed since creation.\nFilters There are filters on this page mutual for both tabs (Events and History):\n \u0026ldquo;ENDPOINT FILTER\u0026rdquo; - This filter is preselected and it filters events for selected endpoint. \u0026ldquo;TAG FILTER\u0026rdquo; - This filter is populated with the selected endpoint tags and is not preselected. It filters events for selected tag. \u0026ldquo;SEARCH FILTER\u0026rdquo; (by name) - This filters events by name that contains the search string. \u0026ldquo;EVENT TYPE\u0026rdquo; - This filters only the events from selected type. \u0026ldquo;IN GRACE PERIOD\u0026rdquo; - If this is checked than only events that are in grace period will be displayed. Otherwise only the events that are not in a grace period are listed.  For Events tab we also have:\n \u0026ldquo;EVENT STATE\u0026rdquo; - This filters the events that have the selected event state. \u0026ldquo;ACKNOWLEDGED STATE\u0026rdquo; - This filters the events that have the selected acknowledged state.

After we fill the data we click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button to save the user.\nFig 3. Scopes\r\rFig 4. Add user\r\rEdit user User can be edited by clicking on this row button . Scopes for the user can always be edited. Name, email and mobile are not editable in case of a user that is synced from external active directory. Role can be edited if the user account email domain belongs to the organization domains.\nFig 5. Edit user\r\rDelete user If the user account email domain belongs to the organization domains, then the button is provided and if clicked a confirmation popup will appear.
