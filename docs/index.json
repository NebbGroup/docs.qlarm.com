	"content": "QLARM dashboards are designed to display the custom dashboards along with various configured widgets. It is highly flexible and enables you to create your own dashboards and share between other dashboard viewers. QLARM comes with a variety of premade configurable dashboard widgets that you can use to build a specific dashboard view that meets the different needs of your business.\r\rOverview The Dashboard View contains two main components, configuration header and display grid. The configuration header contains essential functionalities for dashboard configuration which can be accessed by clicking the button. The display grid displays the available dashboards that can be selected from the dashboards list, and there you can configure the presentation and layout of the widgets within the selected dashboard.\r\rFig 1. Dashboard configuration\r\rWorking with Dashboards In the following sections we will explain the two main functionalities of QLARM dashboards:\n Viewing Dashboards Managing Dashboards  Viewing Dashboards Default Dashboard Upon logging into QLARM a default dashboard is displayed. a System Dashboard is present to be the default dashboard nevertheless, any other dashboard that is available can be selected to be the new default dashboard by checking the \"Default\" checkbox .\r\rDashboard list The Dashboard drop down list allows you to select the dashboard you want to view. All the available dashboards are listed here, including the default System Dashboard and other dashboards that are shared by other users. You can always filter the list to view the custom dashboards that are predefined in the system by checking \"Mine\" checkbox . \rDashboard themes The theme dropdown list is used to select and change the visual colour of the dashboard view you are choosing to configure. By default, the light theme is selected, other themes, include the blue, dark and extra dark theme.\r\rSharing a Dashboard By checking the \"Share\" checkbox , you can enable a selected dashboard that you configured and share it with the other users.\r\rManaging Dashboards Configure header The configuration header contains the main functionalities that allow us to configure dashboards to our needs. In view mode, you can view different dashboards that are available, and you can change them from the dashboard dropdown list. You can enter edit mode by clicking the button.\rFig 2. Configure header in view mode\r\rIn edit mode the configuration header is changed by adding new functionalities so we can configure dashboards.\nFig 3. Configure header in edit mode\r\r\rDashboard configuring The right cluster of buttons contains the main functionalities for configuring the dashboard you are working on.\r\rFig 4. Configure functionalities for dashboard\r\rNew Dashboard and Add Widgets The \"New Dashboard\" button allows you to create a new dashboard. When you go to New Dashboard, a new window opens to configure your new dashboard. You can select a name for it under the \"Dashboard Name\" field and add custom widgets.\rFig 5. Configure functionalities for dashboard\r\rWhen you select a widget from the list, it is shown on the grid panel. Drag and drop to rearrange widgets to the desired location on the grid and resize them by using the widget handle located in the lower right angle on every widget or by drag and drop edges and corners. After configuring the dashboard layout you can click the button to save the dashboard or the button if you do not want to save the dashboard. Afterwards, if we need to add additional widgets to the dashboard we only need to click the button by which we are greeted with the same window as if we were creating a new dashboard.\nAll widget can be configured by opening the widget menu and selecting “Edit Widget”. A new edit widget view opens which allows you to configure it. Every widget has its own unique configuration parameter (more on this in the Widgets subsection).\nFig 6. Widget components\r\rYou can save the widget configuration by clicking the button, or you can close the edit window by clicking the button.\nFig 7. Edit widget mode\r\rWhen the widget configuration is complete, the Widget menu is updated with the new options defined by the widget.\n\rWidgets The widget list contains eight different types of widgets that can be added one by one from the list.\r Latest Value widget - shows the latest value of a selected sensor. In the “Subjects” tab you can select an endpoint and tags available from that endpoint for which we want to see the latest value. You can also give the widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value widgets. In the “Ranges” tab you can adjust custom ranges to view the latest value in a certain colour, if it falls in that range. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 8. Last value widget menu\r\r Latest Value Gauge - shows the latest value of a selected sensor using a gauge with custom range values and colours. In the “Subjects” tab you can select an endpoint and tags available from that endpoint for which we want to see the latest value. You can also give the widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value Gauge widgets. In the “Ranges” tab you can adjust the appearance of the gauge. First you need to set the minimum and maximum value and the base colour of the scale. Then you can add custom ranges on the scale to view the latest value in a certain colour, if it falls in that range. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 9. Last value gauge widget menu\r\r Tag state - shows the state of a selected sensor by setting custom range values and different colours. In the “Subjects” tab we select an endpoint and tags available from that endpoint for which we want to see the tag state. You can also give the widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value widgets. In the “States” tab you can adjust custom ranges to view the tag state in a certain colour, if it falls in that range. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 10. Tag state widget menu\r\r Tag chart - displays tag chart values for a selected period In the “Subjects” tab you can select an endpoint and tags available from that endpoint which you want to see the tag chart. You can also give the widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value widgets. In the “Interval” tab you can adjust the unit of time, number and colour of time units. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 11. Tag chart widget menu\r\r Elapsed time for endpoint - displays latest log events from the endpoint. In the “Subjects” tab you can select an endpoint to see the elapsed time. In the “Data” and “Event” tabs you can add intervals with different ranges and colours that represent the “Last Data” and “Last Event”. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 12. Elapsed time for endpoint widget menu\r\r Elapsed time for system - displays latest log events in the system. Go to “Subjects” tab and select an endpoint to see the elapsed time. In the “Data” and “Event” tabs you can add intervals with different ranges and colours to represent the “Last Data” and “Last Event”. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 13. Elapsed time for system widget menu\r\r Endpoint state - shows the current connection state of an endpoint. In the “Subject” tab you can select an endpoint to monitor its state. In the \u0026ldquo;States\u0026rdquo; tab we add colors for the \u0026ldquo;ONLINE\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;OFFLINE\u0026rdquo; status. The \u0026ldquo;Labels\u0026rdquo; tab contains additional settings for configuring the widget.  Fig 14. Endpoint state widget menu\r\r System status - shows the system cumulative health status for all endpoints states. Go to “Statuses” tab to add colours for the “OK”, “BROKEN” and “SYSTEM SHUTDOWN” status. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 15. System status widget menu\r\r\rSave Dashboard To keep the changes in the dashboard we can save the configurations by clicking on the button.\nDiscard Dashboard The button discards all of the applied changes we did in the dashboard we are configuring.\nDelete Dashboard The button deletes the selected dashboard that we have configured.\nCopy Dashboard Whenever you are viewing a dashboard created by another user, you can copy the existing dashboard by clicking on the button. This will ask you if you want to rename the dashboard and save the copy as your own after clicking the button.\r\rFig 16. Save copy of dashboard\r\rExit Dashboard The button allows us to leave the edit mode and get back to the view mode.\n"

	"content": "Event view is listing the current and the past events in tabs Events and History, respectively. Sorting on column and various filtering are provided for both tabs. Events tab events have details provided in collapsible row and can be edited. Both Events and History data have Logs.\rIf the event optains many tags then the name displayed for the event is consisted of the tag name dash (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;) the the name of the custom event.\nFig 1. Events\r\rTypes of Events There are two types of alarms defined in the system now: Alarm and Other. The functional flow for the Alarm type events is: An event instance (Alarm) is Created and then it gets the Creation Date. If there is a grace period defined in the Custom Event, then the event instance is Activated after this grace period. And if not it is activated right after it is created and then it gets the Activation Date. If the reason for the Alarm is gone (the new evaluation does not satisfy the Alarm condition, e.g. the freezer got cold enough again) than the Alarm gets Inactivated if it is in a grace period and then it gets the Inactive Date and Archived if it is in a grace period and then it gets the Archived Date. If the Alarm is Acknowledged by a user, active or inactive, then it gets the Acknowledged date. Every time a real-world alarm happens, before the creation of an alarm in the system, we find the old inactive alarms for the Custom Event (acknowledged or not) and we archive them, then they get the Archived date. Custom Event can be edited or deleted. Alarms that happen because of it are Archived, then they get the Archived date. The functional flow for the Other type events is: An event instance (Event) is Created and then it gets the Creation Date. If there is a grace period defined in the Custom Event, then the event instance is Activated after this grace period. And if not it is activated right after it is created and then it gets the Activation Date. If the reason for the Event is gone (the new evaluation does not satisfy the Event condition) than the Event gets Archived, then it gets the Archived Date. Custom Event can be edited or deleted. Alarms that happen because of it are Archived, then they get the Archived date.\nColumns According to the explanation above, for Alarm we can expect:\n Creation time Activation time Inactive time Acknowledged time Archived time  And for Other type of event we can expect:\n Creation time Activation time Archived time  They both have State : In grace period or not, and that only depend of the time passed since creation.\nFilters There are filters on this page mutual for both tabs (Events and History):\n \u0026ldquo;ENDPOINT FILTER\u0026rdquo; - This filter is preselected and it filters events for selected endpoint. \u0026ldquo;TAG FILTER\u0026rdquo; - This filter is populated with the selected endpoint tags and is not preselected. It filters events for selected tag. \u0026ldquo;SEARCH FILTER\u0026rdquo; (by name) - This filters events by name that contains the search string. \u0026ldquo;EVENT TYPE\u0026rdquo; - This filters only the events from selected type. \u0026ldquo;IN GRACE PERIOD\u0026rdquo; - If this is checked than only events that are in grace period will be displayed. Otherwise only the events that are not in a grace period are listed.  For Events tab we also have:\n \u0026ldquo;EVENT STATE\u0026rdquo; - This filters the events that have the selected event state. \u0026ldquo;ACKNOWLEDGED STATE\u0026rdquo; - This filters the events that have the selected acknowledged state.

Logs Events listed in both Event view and History tab have logs provided. They can be reached by clicking the row context menu and than choose \u0026ldquo;Logs\u0026rdquo;. Logs display tracking data about the event. What has happen, when and by who. There is also a possibility for a user to add a custom log (a comment).\nFig 5. Logs\r\rEvent view Actions Event view events can be acknowledged from this view by clicking the relevant row \u0026ldquo;ACK\u0026rdquo; button.
