	"content": "QLARM dashboards are designed to display the custom dashboards along with various configured widgets. It is highly flexible and enables you to create your own dashboards and share between other dashboard viewers. QLARM comes with a variety of configurable dashboard widgets that you can use to build a specific dashboard view that meets the different needs of your business. They provide you real-time monitoring of sensor values with configurable states which makes the detection of desired on undesired behaviours much more easier.\rOverview The Dashboard View contains two main components, configuration header and display grid. The configuration header contains essential functionalities for dashboard configuration which can be accessed by clicking the button. The display grid displays the available dashboards that can be selected from the dashboards list, and there you can configure the presentation and layout of the widgets within the selected dashboard.\r\rFig 1. Dashboard configuration\r\r\u0026times;\r\r\rWorking with Dashboards In the following sections, the two main functionalities of QLARM dashboards are explained:\n Viewing Dashboards Managing Dashboards  Viewing Dashboards Default Dashboard Upon logging into QLARM a default dashboard is displayed. The default dashboard at first login is the System dashboard, but any other dashboard that is available can be selected to be the new default dashboard by checking the \"Default\" checkbox .\r\rDashboard list The Dashboard drop down list allows you to select the dashboard you want to view. All the available dashboards are listed here, including the default System Dashboard and other dashboards that are shared by other users. You can always filter the list to view the custom dashboards that are predefined in the system by checking \"Mine\" checkbox . \rDashboard themes The theme dropdown list is used to select and change the visual colour of the dashboard view you are choosing to configure. By default, the light theme is selected, other themes, include the blue, dark and extra dark theme.\r\rSharing a Dashboard By checking the \"Share\" checkbox , you can enable a selected dashboard that you configured and share it with the other users.\r\rManaging Dashboards Configure header The configuration header contains the main functionalities that allow you to configure dashboards to your needs. In view mode, you can view different dashboards that are available, and you can change them from the dashboard dropdown list. You can enter edit mode by clicking the button.\rFig 2. Configure header in view mode\r\rIn edit mode the configuration header is changed by adding new functionalities so you can configure dashboards.\nFig 3. Configure header in edit mode\r\r\rDashboard configuration The right cluster of buttons contains the main functionalities for configuring the dashboard you are working on.\r\rFig 4. Configure functionalities for dashboard\r\rNew Dashboard and Add Widgets The \"New Dashboard\" button allows you to create a new dashboard. When you go to New Dashboard, a new window opens to configure your new dashboard. You can select a name for it under the \"Dashboard Name\" field and add custom widgets.\rFig 5. Creating a new dashboard\r\rWhen you select a widget from the list, it is shown on the grid panel. To organize the widgets in the grip panel you can drag and drop them to the desired location and order. To resize a widget, use the widget handle located in the lower right corner on every widget or by drag and drop edges and corners. After configuring the dashboard layout you can click the button to save the dashboard or the button if you do not want to save the dashboard. Afterwards, if you need to add additional widgets to the dashboard, you only need to click the button by which you are greeted with the same window as if you were creating a new dashboard.\nAll widget can be configured by opening the widget menu and selecting “Edit Widget”. A new edit widget view opens which allows you to configure it. Every widget has its own unique configuration parameter (more on this in the Widgets subsection).\nFig 6. Widget components\r\rYou can save the widget configuration by clicking the button, or you can close the edit window by clicking the button.\nFig 7. Edit widget mode\r\rWhen the widget configuration is complete, the Widget menu is updated with the new options defined by the widget.\n\rWidgets The widget list contains eight different types of widgets that can be added one by one from the list.\r Latest Value widget - shows the latest value of a selected sensor. In the “Subjects” tab you can select an endpoint and tags available from that endpoint for which you want to see the latest value. You can also give the widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value widgets. In the “Ranges” tab you can adjust custom ranges to view the latest value in a certain colour, if it falls in that range. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 8. Last value widget menu\r\r Latest Value Gauge - shows the latest value of a selected sensor using a gauge with custom range values and colours. In the “Subjects” tab you can select an endpoint and tags available from that endpoint for which you want to see the latest value. You can also give the widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value Gauge widgets. In the “Ranges” tab you can adjust the appearance of the gauge. First you need to set the minimum and maximum value and the base colour of the scale. Then you can add custom ranges on the scale to view the latest value in a certain colour, if it falls in that range. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 9. Last value gauge widget menu\r\r Tag state - shows the state of a selected sensor by setting custom range values and different colours. In the “Subjects” tab you can select an endpoint and tags available from that endpoint for which you want to see the tag state. You can also give the widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value widgets. In the “States” tab you can adjust custom ranges to view the tag state in a certain colour, if it falls in that range. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 10. Tag state widget menu\r\r Tag chart - displays tag chart values for a selected period. In the “Subjects” tab you can select an endpoint and tags available from that endpoint for which you want to see the tag chart. You can also give the widget an alias name to differ from the other Latest Value widgets. In the “Interval” tab you can adjust the unit of time, number and colour of time units. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 11. Tag chart widget menu\r\r Elapsed time for endpoint - displays latest log events from the endpoint. In the “Subjects” tab you can select an endpoint to see the elapsed time. In the “Data” and “Event” tabs you can add intervals with different ranges and colours that represent the “Last Data” and “Last Event”. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 12. Elapsed time for endpoint widget menu\r\r Elapsed time for system - displays latest log events in the system. Go to “Subjects” tab and select an endpoint to see the elapsed time. In the “Data” and “Event” tabs you can add intervals with different ranges and colours to represent the “Last Data” and “Last Event”. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 13. Elapsed time for system widget menu\r\r Endpoint state - shows the current connection state of an endpoint. In the “Subject” tab you can select an endpoint to monitor its state. In the \u0026ldquo;States\u0026rdquo; tab you can add colours for the \u0026ldquo;ONLINE\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;OFFLINE\u0026rdquo; status. The \u0026ldquo;Labels\u0026rdquo; tab contains additional settings for configuring the widget.  Fig 14. Endpoint state widget menu\r\r System status - shows the system cumulative health status for all endpoints states. Go to “Statuses” tab to add colours for the “OK”, “BROKEN” and “SYSTEM SHUTDOWN” status. The “Labels” tab contains additional settings for widget configuration.  Fig 15. System status widget menu\r\r\rSave Dashboard To keep the changes in the dashboard you can save the configurations by clicking on the button.\nDiscard Dashboard The button discards all the applied changes you did in the dashboard you are configuring.\nDelete Dashboard The button deletes the selected dashboard that you have configured.\nCopy Dashboard Whenever you are viewing a dashboard created by another user, you can copy the existing dashboard by clicking on the button. This will ask you if you want to rename the dashboard and save the copy as your own after clicking the button.\r\rFig 16. Save copy of dashboard\r\rExit Dashboard The button allows us to leave the edit mode and get back to the view mode.\n\r// Get the modal\rvar modal = document.getElementById(\"myModal\");\rvar modalImg = document.getElementById(\"img01\");\rvar captionText = document.getElementById(\"caption\");\rfunction reply_click(img)\r{\rmodal.style.display = \"block\";\rmodalImg.src = img.src;\rcaptionText.innerHTML = img.alt;\r}\rmodal.onclick = function() { modal.style.display = \"none\";\r}\rdocument.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {\rif (e.keyCode == 27) {\rmodal.style.display = \"none\";\r}\r});\r  "

	"content": "\u0026times;\r\r\rIn Events page you events are listed. It is an accurate representation with details specified. Events are raised because of a custom event condition met. Current event is an ongoing process and can pass different phases due to its definition. Archived events are finished processes. Event view lists the current and the past events in tabs Events and History. Sort on column and various filtering are provided for both tabs. Custom event for the event can be edited. Events have Logs for the phases the event has passed.\rIf the event obtains many tags, then the name displayed for the event is consisted of the tag name dash (\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;) the the name of the custom event.\nFig 1. Events\r\rTypes of Events There are two types of events defined in the system: Alarm and Other. The functional flow for the Alarm type events is: An event instance (Alarm) is Created and then it gets the Creation Date. If there is a grace period defined in the Custom Event, then the event instance is Activated after the grace period expires. And if not it is activated right after it is created and then it gets the Activation Date. If the new evaluation does not meet the Alarm condition, the Alarm gets Inactivated if it is not in a grace period (Inactive Date), on the other hand, if it is in a grace period it gets Archived (Archived Date). Being active or inactive, event can be Acknowledged by a user (Acknowledged date). Every time an event condition is met, before the creation of an event instance, system finds the old inactive alarm for the Custom Event (acknowledged or not) and it archives it (Archived date). Custom Event can be edited or deleted. In this case its instances gets Archived (Archived date). The functional flow for the Other type events is: An event instance is Created (Creation Date). If there is a grace period defined in the Custom Event, the event instance is Activated after this grace period. And if not, it is activated right after it is created (Activation Date). If the new evaluation does not meet the Event condition, the Event gets Archived, (Archived Date). Custom Event can be edited or deleted. In this case its instances gets Archived (Archived date).\nColumns Columns for Alarm type are:\n Creation time Activation time Inactive time Acknowledged time Archived time  Columns for Other type are:\n Creation time Activation time Archived time  Both types of Events have State: They can be in grace period or not. This depends on the time elapsed since creation.\nFilters The following filters are available for both Events and History tabs:\n \u0026ldquo;ENDPOINT FILTER\u0026rdquo; - the endpoint filter is preselected and is used to select events created for any of the tags of the selected endpoint. \u0026ldquo;TAG FILTER\u0026rdquo; - tag filter is populated with the selected endpoint tags and is not preselected. It filters events for selected tag. \u0026ldquo;SEARCH FILTER\u0026rdquo; (by name) - filters the events with a name that contains the search string. \u0026ldquo;EVENT TYPE\u0026rdquo; - f only the events from selected type. \u0026ldquo;IN GRACE PERIOD\u0026rdquo; - If checked than only events that are in grace period will be displayed. If this is not the case, only the events that are not in a grace period will be listed.  In the Events tab there are also:\n \u0026ldquo;EVENT STATE\u0026rdquo; - filters the events that have the selected event state. \u0026ldquo;ACKNOWLEDGED STATE\u0026rdquo; - filters the events that have the selected acknowledged state.  Fig 2. Event view filter options\r\rIn the History tab there are also:\n \u0026ldquo;DATE FILTER\u0026rdquo; - filters the events by creation date.  Fig 3.
